## ncbi::sra-human-scrubber 
### Description
The human read removal tool (HRRT) is based on the [SRA Taxonomy Analysis Tool](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02490-0) that will take as input a fastq file, and produce as output a fastq.clean file in which all reads identified as potentially of human origin are removed.
### Overview
Briefly, the HRRT is based on a k-mer database that is constructed from the k-mers derived from all human RefSeq records and subtracts the library of k-mers generated from all non-Eukaryota RefSeq records. The remaining set of k-mers are the database used to ID human reads by the removal tool. This means it tends to be aggressive about identifying human reads since it contains not only human-specific k-mers, but also k-mers common to primates, mammals, and other lineages further up the Eukaryotic tree. However, it is also fairly conservative at maintaining any viral or bacterial clinical pathogen sequences. It takes a fastq file as input, removes any reads with hits to the 'human' k-mer database and outputs a fastq.clean with the identified human reads removed.
### Quick Start
* Clone the repo.
* `pushd` or `cd` to directory `sra-human-scrubber`.
	* Alternatively, download the zip file from the green 'Code' button, unzip it, then cd to directory `sra-human-scrubber-master`.
* Execute `./init_db.sh` in directory `sra-human-scrubber` - this will retrieve the pre-built db from ftp and place it in the directory `sra-human-scrubber/data` where it needs to be located.
* Please note binary `aligns_to`in bin was compiled on x86_64 GNU/Linux. 



### Usage
Working in the directory `sra-human-scrubber` (or alternatively `sra-human-scrubber-master`)
#### Invoke the test 
Here the command is simply given the (file) argument `test`
`./scripts/scrub.sh test`

#### Remove human reads from fastq file

Here the command is given the path to your local fastq file as argument
`./scripts/scrub.sh path-to-fastq-file/filename.fastq`

Example:
`./scripts/scrub.sh Runs/SRR13402847.fastq`
